== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with all WordPress themes? =

Yes, AuthPress is designed to work with any WordPress theme. The login customizations only affect the wp-login.php page and don't interfere with your theme's design.

= Can I customize the login page for specific user roles? =

Currently, customizations apply globally to all users. However, you can configure role-based redirects after login, which can create different experiences for different user types.

= What happens if I deactivate the plugin? =

If you deactivate AuthPress, your login page will revert to the default WordPress login design. However, your settings are preserved in the database and will be restored if you reactivate the plugin.

= Is 2FA authentication mandatory for all users? =

No, you can enable or disable 2FA from the plugin settings. When enabled, you can also choose to bypass 2FA for administrators if needed.

= Will hiding the login page break my site's functionality? =

No, the hide login feature simply redirects the default wp-login.php to a custom URL. As long as you provide the custom URL to your users, they can still access the login form. Logged-in users and specific actions (like password reset) are exempted from the redirect.

= Can I use this plugin on multiple sites? =

Yes, you can install AuthPress on unlimited WordPress sites. If you have a multisite installation, you may want to consider network activation for consistent settings across all sites.

= Does the math captcha support accessibility? =

The math captcha uses simple text-based questions that can be read by screen readers. However, for full WCAG compliance, you may want to review the specific challenges provided.
